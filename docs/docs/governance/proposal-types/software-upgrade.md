## Why make a Software Upgrade Proposal?

A **software upgrade proposal** is a proposal made to update the running software version for the Cosmos Hub network. The proposal could entail adding new features to the Cosmos Hub, adding performance improvements, improving the stabilty of the network or simply fixing vulnerabilities.

This type of proposal, like others, can be made by anyone, but typically it is made by the development team that is maintaining the Github repo for `gaia`.

## What happens when a Software Upgrade Proposal passes?

When a proposal is made on-chain and is accepted, validators have to update the running software version for the Cosmos Hub network in a co-ordinated fashion. The 'co-ordinated' part here, means that all validators MUST upgrade their software at a specified block height that is specified in the proposal.
